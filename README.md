# Steam Deck Discord Status

Updates Discord Rich Presence with the currently running game while on Steam Deck.

## Future Improvements

-   Better detection of Discord being launched (currently depends on non-Steam application with name set to "Discord")
-   Current application switcher, to better handle having multiple applications running, and sending the correct one for
    the "currently playing" status
